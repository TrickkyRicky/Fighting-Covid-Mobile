# Fighting-Covid-Mobile
## Description
This is part two of the capstone project which was made with [expo](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/create-a-new-app/) as the base for the project.
Using firebase as the database to extract the data via endpoint API call. The application takes information from an arduino base sanitation station
and the mobile application uses this information to show users analytics of how each station is progressing. The goal for this part of the project
was to make a mobile dashboard that notifies the user when the station is low on liquid sanitation.
### Features
- React Redux (global store for state management)
- React Hooks (used to handle page routes)
- React Navigation (pushes mobile screens to users)
- Expo Notifications (handles notifying the user via push token)

These are the most important packages, but there are many more you can check out in the package.json file.
